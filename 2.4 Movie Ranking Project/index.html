<h1>The Best Movies According to Clare</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Harry Potter 1-7</h3>
<p>These films are timeless and magical. They take you on the journey of a young boy called Harry Potter, who learns that he is a wizard and a famous one too.</p>

<h3>Star Wars - Episodes IV, V and VI</h3>
<p>Out of all the star wars movies these are still by far my favourite. The effects they created back in the 70's/80's were unbelievable and some of the best cinematography.</p>

<h3>Labyrinth</h3>
<p>A musical fantasy featuring the amazing David Bowie as the the Goblin King. I loved the characters in this movie.</p>
