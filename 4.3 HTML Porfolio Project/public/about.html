<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Clare. I am a mum to 2 girls called Evangeline aged 9 years and Isabelle aged 5 years. For the past 16 years I have been a manual tester
  and recently I decided to self study coding and taught myself Javascript, HTML and CSS. 
  Two years later I gained the promotion to a Software Developer Engineer in Test (SDET).
  I work for Dunelm and have been with them for two and a half years now.

    <li>Oil and Gas</li>

<p>When I am not studying or working I love to spend time with my family and our 2 dogs. We have a 18 month old fox red labrador called Arthur and a 11 month old mini
  dachshund called Fred.
  I also enjoy singing and can often find me at karaoke!
